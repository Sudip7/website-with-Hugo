The objective of this post is to keep track of learning I do each day.
This is part of my new year resolution to learn things in a better and effective way.

* *1st Jan 2019*

** Today I was suppossed to start learning python that I planned couple of days ago. Although I prepared
   initial plans and list of resources I want to try something different this time. So instead of learning the python and it's 
   syntax and some code practice I will learn following things first

**** Summary for today :
***** Mind has two different modes for learning : focused and diffused mode each having different capabilities
***** Learning something difficult takes time similar to building muscles. It needs regular practice each day.
      So to overcome any difficult aspect of learning need to learn and practice the subject each day.

*** Some sort of gamification approach to keep track of my habit. This is a experiment as I almost lost
    the habbit of consistency. https://www.taskheroics.com
