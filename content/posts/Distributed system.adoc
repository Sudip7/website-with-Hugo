* A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and 
  coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another. The components interact with one another in order to achieve a common goal.

* Some good reads to understand the complexities and challanges involed in developement and maintainance of these systems.

* Traditionally to achieve concurrency threads and locks are used in abudance as those systems are easy to develope and inspect.
  But as size of application grows and it become distributed over worldwide the above aproach has of little to no use. So now
  most of large systems being actively developed are looking towards asynchronous and functional programming approach.
